General program structure
============================
The Program entry point is contained in main.cpp. It creates an instance of Application and calls the run function within a try catch block.

The Application class itself contains all main program modules and keeps the simulation running. The main loop is roughly separated in Update and Draw. Update processes all inputs, Draw updates the RendererSystem and the visible content of the OutputWindow.

The application can be started with a script (which is handed to ScriptProcessing) or blank, relying completely on command line input. Command line input will be forwarded to the ScriptProcessing module which mainly changes global config variables, defined in the GlobalConfig module.

At startup a single instance of RendererSystem is created. RendererSystem holds up to one Renderer and DebugRenderer.


RendererSystem
============================
The RendererSystem provides a framework for all other renderers.

Each call to RendererSystem::Draw is called iteration and usually increases the iteration count if no DebugRenderer is set (and not manipulated elsewhere).

It provides several buffer(views) which are available to all renderers:
* Scene data in texture buffers views (for binding indices see RendererSystem::TextureBufferBindings, GPU sided definition in "shader/scenedata.glsl")
  * triangles (Scene::GetTriangleBuffer)
  * vertex positions (Scene::GetVertexPositionBuffer)
  * vertex info (texcoord, normal, see Scene::GetVertexInfoBuffer)
  * basic hierarchy info (bounding volumes + child & escape pointer, see Scene::GetHierarchyBuffer)
  * initial light samples
* Uniform buffers (for binding indices see RendererSystem::UniformBufferBindings, GPU sided definition in "shader/globaluniforms.glsl")
  * global const (expected to change extremly rarely)
  * camera (expected to change only on camera movements)
  * per iteration (expected to change every iteration)

Glhelper allows to create uniform buffers from shader-meta-info. To create the mentioned UBOs, a special dummy shader is used (GLSL UBO layout is set to `shared`).

The RendererSystem contains its own HDR (RGBA32F) "backbuffer" that can be obtained with RendererSystem::GetBackbuffer(). All rendering happens in either Renderer or DebugRenderer.

### InitialLightSamples ###
"InitialLightSamples" are changing random pointsamples on the scene`s light. Samples are recreated during RendererSystem::PerIterationBufferUpdate using LightTriangleSampler::GenerateRandomSamples. A renderer needs to specify how many initial light samples are needed using RendererSystem::SetNumInitialLightSamples. Currently the value is hardcoded for each individual renderer. Note that before this call no light samples are created.

Renderer
----------------------------
Renderers are set using RendererSystem::SetRenderer. It is not possible to set multiple Renderers at once. Setting a new Renderer will destroy the old one, reset the iteration count and clear the backbuffer. Each Renderer constructor is expected to expect a reference to the overlaying RendererSystem in the constructor.

### Type Overview ###
* Pathtracer
  * Simple pathtracer, useful for rendering ground truth images

* LightPathtracer
  * Sends rays from the light instead of camera. Each ray will perform a next event estimation to the camera.
  * Writing to pixels involves a spin-lock on the affected pixel (uses an additional image for locks).

* BidirectionalPathtracer
  * Bidirectional pathtracer using a lightcache as described by \cite bib:GPUSurvey2014
  * Multiple importance weights as in \cite bib:AntwerpenStreamingPathtracing
  * Light cache size is determined by a startup pass in BidirectionalPathtracer::CreateLightCacheWithCapacityEstimate

* HierarchyImportance
  * Obtains "importance" for all triangles using a pathtracer. For each path vertex all preceeding triangle-hits will increase their importance by the received radiance.
  * Propagation through the hierachy can be performed using HierarchyImportance::UpdateHierarchyNodeImportance
  * Hierachy information buffer (SSBO) is available as shared pointer (for later use in other renderers) using HierarchyImportance::GetHierachyImportance


### General Notes ###
* `SHOW_SPECIFIC_PATHLENGTH`
  * All existing Renderer provide the possibility to show only the results of a given pathlength, ignoring radiance obtained from all paths with different lengths. To enable this feature define `SHOW_SPECIFIC_PATHLENGTH x` in renderer.hpp, with `x` beeing the desired pathlength.

DebugRenderer
----------------------------
DebugRenderers are set using RendererSystem::SetDebugRenderer. The call only succeeds if there is set Renderer. Setting a new DebugRenderer or changing the Renderer will destroy the previous DebugRenderer. As long as a DebugRenderer is called, Renderer::Draw will redirect to the DebugRenderer. This will also suppress calls to Renderer::PerIterationBufferUpdate. To stop debug rendering and resume the normal renderer call RendererSystem::DisableDebugRenderer. This will destroy the DebugRenderer and switch back to the Renderer. Note that while switching DebugRendering does contain all Renderer relevant data, Camera movements may not.

### Type Overview ###
* RaytraceMeshInfo
  * Displays various scene information using a raytracer
  * Display type can be set via GlobalConfig
  
* HierarchyVisualization
  * Displays the scene hierachy as boxes (solid or wireframe)
  * By default, coloring is defined by heatmap from low hierachy levels (hot) to high hierarchy levels (cold)
  * If the active Renderer is of type HierarchyImportance, the coloring displays the importance of the node. Switiching to the HierarchyVisualization will then automatically call HierarchyImportance::UpdateHierarchyNodeImportance

* glsl
  * used as include file only
* comp
  * compute shader
* frag
  * fragment shader
* vert
  * vertex shader

Overview of shader files. Configurations are done via #define macros (can be set via another shader file before #include or at runtime using gl::ShaderObject::AddShaderFromFile).

ScriptProcessing & GlobalConfig
==============================
GPUGI uses a simple command list script to make configuration at runtime or per file possible. Commands are parsed via ScriptProcessing. Console inputs are continously read in a separate thread (see ScriptProcessing::StartConsoleWindowThread and ScriptProcessing::StopConsoleWindowThread) and evaluated together with script commands during a ScriptProcessing::ProcessCommandQueue call.

With the exception of a few built-in commands, all commands will be passed to GlobalConfig. GlobalConfig is a namespace containing several functions to control a global variable pool. Since variables are lists of Variants (see GlobalConfig::ParameterType) and each variable can have an arbitrary number of listeners, _empty parameters can be used for global callbacks_ enabling the ScriptProcessing module to act like an event-manager.

GlobalConfig is based on the Variant template class (see GlobalConfig::ParameterElementType). An instance of variant is guaranteed to be able to be converted to the provided template parameter. Note that it needs at least as much memory as the smallest given type (there might be additional padding).


Reserved/Built-In Commands
----------------------------
A script without any wait command will processed in a single call of ScriptProcessing::ProcessCommandQueue. To be able to run a Renderer in between use one of the following buildt-in wait commands:

* waitIterations [uint]
  * Stops script processing for the given number of update calls.
* waitSeconds [float]
  * Stops script processing until the given number of seconds has passed since the last ScriptProcessing::ProcessCommandQueue call.

To create custom commands that cancel the script processing register a command via ScriptProcessing::AddProcessingPauseCommand.

To show a list of all commands and their documention in the console use _help_.


TextureMSE
==============================
Class for computing the mean squared error of two images on the GPU. Reference image can be loaded from pfm. Application provides a binding to ScriptProcessing that makes it possible to wait for a Renderer to converge to a reference until a given MSE is reached.
